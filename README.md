# Open-Sourse-STL-Polymer-Weathering
Please find an online repository for the 3D printing STL files for the components of my polymer weathering experiments. 

STL files to be sliced using your prefered slicer and printed for use with 90mm PVC pipe. 
Tolerances have been designed for my application, printer and overall setup. 

CAD files were created in Fusion 360.
